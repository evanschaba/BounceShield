when the game starts, there should be a count down animation followed by a 'GAME START' text animation !
when the game starts, the ball should bounce on the bar and not stick
when the game starts, the current score should increment once ! per bounce off the bar
when the game starts, the ball should spawn at a random location
when the there are no more hearts, the game should end, recording the current score as the highest score and animate the 'press 'R' to retry' text
after retry, the heart score logic should come into functionality, to gain an extra heart life, the current score should start from 0 in a retry game, increment all the way to the high score, after matching the highscore, the game should give them an extra heart, if they double their high score, they should earn ANOTHER heart, if they drop the ball whether in a retry game or the first game (without a highscore, they should get punished, the ball speeds up a little bit & the horizontal bar should become shorter
